            I'm just an ordinary student of University of Basilicata, Italy (<a href="https://www.unibas.it">Unibas</a>).
            I'm currently attending the last year of Computer Science in Potenza, and possibly getting a bachelor's degree this year.<br>
            I am also part of the student association "<a href="https://www.gbux097uni.it">GBUx097Uni</a>", so if you ever were to visit our campus, we'll gladly welcome you with some fresh brew Italian espresso.<br><br>
            Computer Science has always been one of my passions, though it's not the only one! I also really enjoy playing guitar and photography - a recent discovery!
            Speaking of which, I recently started an IG page about photography, you can find <a href="https://www.instagram.com/komorebi.log/"> here</a>.<br><br>
            You can find some of my public project in the relative section. I'm planning to populate my <a href="https://github.com/sandangl">github page</a> with some funny projects.<br><br>
            Thank you for visiting my boring page, and stick around for more.<br>
